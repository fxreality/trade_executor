To run the project you can write :
go run main.go order.go dbHandler.go wsHandler.go trade.go

- first it will create database and the tables
- then you can insert the values like :

Enter asset pair: btcusdt
buy/sell: buy
Enter price: 1980
Enter size: 2

After that the market prices will be written, and if the price match the trades will be stored into db, and reported on console.

Summary:
I found this project very interesting, as I was working with api endpoint with live data.
I did not knew about “binance” before, so I was happy to learn it.

First, I was reading the documentation about “binance” and then wrote down the requirements.
As I am not yet experienced Golang developer, I had some need to check which web socket libraries exists, and to choose one. 
I liked the most the type creation, and to create a functions on top of that. I am happy to do something new after so long of OO programming. :)
Next funny part was streaming data, which I choose to push to channel.
I spent maybe a bit more than 4 hours on the task, but if I would have more time I will do even more – I will probably in next few weeks, just to add  some unit tests, and more functionality and make it more user friendly.
What I would also like to do is to create trades executions in go routines, so that it will no wasting time in setting market orders.
Unfortunately my daily work is also requires quite some hours per day, so not just the time but the concentration is also what I loose in these late hours.
All in all I had some fun writing this code, hope that it will bring you also some joy reading it.
Best regards,
Jozef
